# Systext

Systext is a textual domain-specific language for systems modeling and tradeoff analysis developed 
as a research project from [School of Information Technology, King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi](https://www.sit.kmutt.ac.th/en/).
The development of DSL is under supervision of Prof. Dr. Dimitris Kolovos

The main design goal of Systext is to provide lightweight systems modeling that allows users to perform the following system modeling tasks

The purpose of this temporary repository is to keep posted advisors the working DSL example 


Systext (under development) is a textual domain-specific language for systems modeling and tradeoff analysis developed as a research project from School of Information Technology, King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi [1] [3] and the development of DSL is under the supervision of Prof, Department of Computer Science, University of York [2].

Ambition (in July 2018)

Develop a textual language for lightweight  systems modeling and trade-off analysis. In the same way that SysML parametric models targeted the engineering analysis of critical system parameters, UML State Machine targeted finite state machine modeling, SysML BDD targets structure modeling, Eclipse XText based language targeted specific applications, 

Desirable features


Tools for Education

Explores the use of textual DSL for  for the representation of graphs of requirements and specification of design component properties.

Viable modeling infrastructure and lightweight MDE tooling 

Explorer the advantages and disadvantages of 
Requirements for scaling 

Keywords: 

Phase I: The main design goal of Systext is to provide lightweight systems modeling that allows users to perform the following system modeling tasks. 
Phase II: The main developer [3] will extend Systext to design a DSL for medication adherence. 
Phase III: Writing two scientific papers (i) Systext: a DSL for lightweight systems modeling and tradeoff analysis  (ii) Model-Based Medication Adherence Design

The purpose of this temporary repository is to keep advisors posted working DSL files and the generated outputs
