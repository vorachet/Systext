# Systext

Systext is a textual domain-specific language for systems modeling and tradeoff analysis developed as a research project from [School of Information Technology, King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi](https://www.sit.kmutt.ac.th/en/)

The main design goal of Systext is to provide lightweight systems modeling that allows users to perform the following system modeling tasks
