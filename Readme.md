## Introduction and Motivation
Systext is a textual domain-specific language for lightweight systems modeling and metamodeling  developed as a research project from [School of Information Technology, King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi][3]. The development of DSL is under supervision of Asst.Prof Dr. Chonlameth. A and Prof. Dr. Dimitris Kolovos (Department of Computer Science, University of York)

This work is intended as a step toward enabling systems modelers to use SysML with a textual DSL and export the result to reasoning tools for design analysis and verification.


The main design goal of Systext is to provide lightweight systems modeling that allows users to perform the following system modeling tasks

The purpose of this temporary repository is to keep posted advisors the working DSL example 

Ambition (in July 2018)

Develop a textual language for lightweight  systems modeling and trade-off analysis. In the same way that SysML parametric models targeted the engineering analysis of critical system parameters, UML State Machine targeted finite state machine modeling, SysML BDD targets structure modeling, Eclipse XText based language targeted specific applications,
